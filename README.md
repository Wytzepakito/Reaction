# React
A simple small blogproject in React, Django and SqlLite. 
This was done to properly learn and test React and django using JWT for the database under construction for my internship, I basicly folowwed VeryAcademy on youtube. In the end I found a solution to avoid the
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing associated with normal normal authentication with Django since storing authentication tokens on the user side might not have been a good idea. This solution was only needed for development.
